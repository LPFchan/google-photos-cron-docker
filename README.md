# google-photos-cron-docker

A Docker container that performs scheduled uploads to Google Photos using
[gotohp](https://github.com/xob0t/gotohp) and
[supercronic](https://github.com/aptible/supercronic).

The configuration style is intentionally similar to
[tgdrive/rclone-backup](https://github.com/tgdrive/rclone-backup), making it
easy to adopt if you are already familiar with that project.

---

## Features

- Scheduled uploads via cron (powered by supercronic)
- Single **or** multiple source → album pairs per container
- Per-pair schedule overrides (`CRON_N`) with automatic grouping
- All `gotohp upload` flags exposed as environment variables
- Per-pair overrides for any upload option (e.g. `GOTOHP_THREADS_0`)
- Credentials stored in a Docker volume — survive container restarts
- Secrets can be supplied via files (`_FILE` suffix) or a `.env` file
- Optional experimental web UI for status and runtime overrides
- Tiny Alpine-based image, pure-Go binary (no webkit/GUI dependencies)

---

## Quick start

Container images are published to GitHub Container Registry at
`ghcr.io/benjithatfoxguy/google-photos-cron-docker`. The tested, stable options
are `:latest` and versioned release tags; the examples below use `:latest`.
Automated nightly builds from `main` are also published as `:nightly`; that is
the intended bleeding-edge tag for users who want to test the newest changes
before a release.
Auto-generated tags may also appear for development branches such as
`experimental` and other feature branches, but those builds are for
development/testing only and should not be used unless you are actively
contributing or helping validate a branch or pull request.

### 1. Obtain Google Photos credentials

gotohp requires mobile-app credentials obtained once from your Android device.
See the [official gotohp README](https://github.com/xob0t/gotohp#requires-mobile-app-credentials-to-work)
for full instructions.  The credential string looks like:

```
androidId=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&...
```

### 2. Configure and run

Copy `docker-compose.yml`, fill in your values, and start:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### 3. Trigger a one-shot backup

```bash
docker compose run --rm photos-backup backup
```

## Environment variables

### Scheduling

| Variable        | Default        | Description               |
|-----------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| `CRON`          | `5 * * * *`    | Global cron expression (applies to all pairs without a `CRON_N` override) |
| `TIMEZONE`      | `UTC`          | Container timezone (e.g. `America/New_York`) |
| `CRON_OVERLAP`  | `queue`        | What to do when a schedule group fires while its previous run is still active (see [Schedule overlap modes](#schedule-overlap-modes)) |

### Web UI (experimental)

| Variable              | Default | Description |
|-----------------------|---------|-------------|
| `WEBUI_BIND`          | `127.0.0.1` when only `WEBUI_PORT` is set; `0.0.0.0` when auth env vars are also set | Interface/address for the web UI HTTP server |
| `WEBUI_PORT`          | `5572`  | Port exposed by the web UI HTTP server |

The web UI is automatically enabled if either `WEBUI_BIND` or `WEBUI_PORT` is specified. When only `WEBUI_PORT` is set and no auth variables (`WEBUI_AUTH`, `WEBUI_USERNAME`, `WEBUI_PASSWORD`, `WEBUI_TOKEN`) are configured, the UI binds to loopback (`127.0.0.1`) to avoid accidental remote exposure. Set `WEBUI_BIND=0.0.0.0` explicitly to expose it on all interfaces. When enabled, the UI serves:

- Live backup status cards (state, timestamps, exit code, pair scope)
- Registered cron entries
- Manual "Run backup now" action with running PID visibility
- Manual backup log tail view
- A plain-text config editor (`VAR=VALUE` lines)

Config edits are written to `/.env` only when that file already exists. This keeps file-backed deployments editable while avoiding creation of a new config file for environment-only deployments.

> **Security note:** The prototype web UI does **not** include authentication.
> Keep it on trusted networks only. Prefer binding to localhost (e.g.
> `WEBUI_BIND=127.0.0.1`) and/or placing it behind a reverse proxy with auth.

#### Per-pair schedule overrides

Each source/album pair can run on its own schedule by setting `CRON_N`.
Pairs that share the same effective schedule (including all pairs without a
`CRON_N` override) are **bundled into a single cron job** and processed
sequentially, preserving the existing behaviour for the common case.

| Variable   | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `CRON_N`   | Cron expression for pair N (e.g. `CRON_0="0 2 * * *"`, `CRON_1="*/30 * * * *"`) |

Example — camera roll syncs every 30 minutes; screenshots sync nightly:

```yaml
CRON: "0 2 * * *"          # default for pairs without an override
CRON_1: "*/30 * * * *"     # pair 1 (screenshots) on its own faster schedule
```

This produces two cron groups:

- `0 2 * * *` — pair 0 (and any other pairs without a `CRON_N`)
- `*/30 * * * *` — pair 1

Different schedule groups always run **concurrently** — they never block each
other.  The `CRON_OVERLAP` variable controls what happens only when the
**same** group fires before its previous invocation has finished.

#### Schedule overlap modes

| `CRON_OVERLAP` value | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `queue` **(default)** | The new invocation waits until the currently-running invocation of the same group finishes, then runs. The triggered run is never skipped. |
| `multithread` | The new invocation starts immediately alongside the already-running invocation. No locking. |
| `skip` | The new invocation is skipped if the same group is already running. A warning is logged. |

### Credentials

| Variable        | Default | Description |
|-----------------|---------|-------------|
| `GOTOHP_CREDS`  | —       | Credential string (`androidId=...`) from your Android device |
| `GOTOHP_EMAIL`  | —       | Active account email or partial match (optional if only one credential is stored) |

Per-pair credential overrides (`GOTOHP_CREDS_N` / `GOTOHP_EMAIL_N`) are also
supported — see [Per-pair credential overrides](#per-pair-credential-overrides).

### Source / Album pairs

Define a single backup job with the shorthand variables, or multiple jobs with
the indexed form.  Both styles may be combined.

| Variable         | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `SOURCE_PATH`    | Path inside the container to upload (alias for `SOURCE_PATH_0`) |
| `ALBUM_NAME`     | Destination album name (alias for `ALBUM_NAME_0`; leave empty to upload to library root) |
| `SOURCE_PATH_N`  | Nth source path (`SOURCE_PATH_0`, `SOURCE_PATH_1`, …) |
| `ALBUM_NAME_N`   | Nth album name; use `AUTO` for per-folder album creation |

### Upload options

| Variable                    | Default | Description |
|-----------------------------|---------|-------------|
| `GOTOHP_THREADS`            | `3`     | Concurrent upload threads |
| `GOTOHP_RECURSIVE`          | `TRUE`  | Include sub-directories |
| `GOTOHP_FORCE`              | `FALSE` | Re-upload even if file already exists in Google Photos |
| `GOTOHP_DELETE`             | `FALSE` | Delete source file after successful upload |
| `GOTOHP_DISABLE_FILTER`     | `FALSE` | Upload all file types, not just media |
| `GOTOHP_DATE_FROM_FILENAME` | `FALSE` | Parse media date from filename (e.g. `20240709_182027.jpg`) |
| `GOTOHP_EXCLUDE`            | `""`    | Skip directories whose name matches this pattern during recursive walk (e.g. `@eaDir`) |
| `GOTOHP_LOG_LEVEL`          | `info`  | Log verbosity: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` |

### Per-pair upload option overrides

Any upload option can be overridden for a specific source/album pair by appending
the pair index to the variable name.  If the per-pair variable is not set, the
global value is used as the default.

| Variable                      | Description |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
| `GOTOHP_THREADS_N`            | Override concurrent threads for pair N |
| `GOTOHP_RECURSIVE_N`          | Override recursive flag for pair N |
| `GOTOHP_FORCE_N`              | Override force flag for pair N |
| `GOTOHP_DELETE_N`             | Override delete flag for pair N |
| `GOTOHP_DISABLE_FILTER_N`     | Override disable-filter flag for pair N |
| `GOTOHP_DATE_FROM_FILENAME_N` | Override date-from-filename flag for pair N |
| `GOTOHP_EXCLUDE_N`            | Override exclude pattern for pair N |
| `GOTOHP_LOG_LEVEL_N`          | Override log level for pair N |

Example — use more threads for the large camera roll but fewer for screenshots:

```yaml
GOTOHP_THREADS: "3"        # default for all pairs
GOTOHP_THREADS_0: "8"      # more threads for SOURCE_PATH_0 (e.g. camera roll)
GOTOHP_THREADS_1: "1"      # fewer threads for SOURCE_PATH_1 (e.g. screenshots)
```

### Per-pair credential overrides

Each source/album pair can optionally use different Google Photos credentials.
Set `GOTOHP_CREDS_N` and `GOTOHP_EMAIL_N` for any pair to upload it to a
different Google account.  Pairs without a per-pair override fall back to the
global `GOTOHP_CREDS` / `GOTOHP_EMAIL`.

| Variable          | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `GOTOHP_CREDS_N`  | Credential string (`androidId=...`) for pair N |
| `GOTOHP_EMAIL_N`  | Active account email for pair N (used to select the credential before upload) |

Both variables support the `_FILE` suffix for secret injection (e.g.
`GOTOHP_CREDS_0_FILE`, `GOTOHP_EMAIL_0_FILE`).

Example — two folders uploaded to two different Google accounts:

```yaml
# Global credential (used by any pair without a per-pair override)
GOTOHP_CREDS:   "androidId=AAAA..."
GOTOHP_EMAIL:   "alice@gmail.com"

SOURCE_PATH_0:  /alice-photos
ALBUM_NAME_0:   "Alice Backup"
# GOTOHP_CREDS_0 / GOTOHP_EMAIL_0 omitted → uses global alice@gmail.com

SOURCE_PATH_1:  /bob-photos
ALBUM_NAME_1:   "Bob Backup"
GOTOHP_CREDS_1: "androidId=BBBB..."   # Bob's credential
GOTOHP_EMAIL_1: "bob@gmail.com"       # switch to Bob's account before uploading pair 1
```

### Secret handling

Every variable above supports a `_FILE` suffix — the container will read the
value from the given path.  This is useful with Docker Secrets:

```yaml
environment:
  GOTOHP_CREDS_FILE: /run/secrets/gotohp_creds
secrets:
  - gotohp_creds
```

Per-pair credential variables follow the same convention
(e.g. `GOTOHP_CREDS_0_FILE`, `GOTOHP_EMAIL_1_FILE`).

Variables can also be placed in a `/.env` file mounted into the container.

## Volumes

| Mount point | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `/config`   | Persists the gotohp credential store and settings across restarts |
| Source dirs | Mount your photo directories here. If you enable [`GOTOHP_DELETE`](#upload-options) or [`GOTOHP_DELETE_N`](#per-pair-upload-option-overrides) to delete files after a successful upload, the mount **must be read-write**. If you are not using delete-after-upload, adding `:ro` to the mount is safe and recommended. |

---

## Examples

### Single source

```yaml
services:
  photos-backup:
    image: ghcr.io/benjithatfoxguy/google-photos-cron-docker:latest
    environment:
      CRON: "0 2 * * *"
      GOTOHP_CREDS: "androidId=..."
      SOURCE_PATH: /photos
      ALBUM_NAME: "My Backup"
      GOTOHP_DELETE: "TRUE"   # delete source file after a successful upload
    volumes:
      - /mnt/photos:/photos       # read-write required when GOTOHP_DELETE is enabled
      - gotohp-config:/config     # persists credentials & config

volumes:
  gotohp-config:
```

> **Note:** If you are not using `GOTOHP_DELETE`, you can add `:ro` to the source
> mount (e.g. `/mnt/photos:/photos:ro`) for an extra layer of safety.

### Multiple sources

```yaml
services:
  photos-backup:
    image: ghcr.io/benjithatfoxguy/google-photos-cron-docker:latest
    environment:
      CRON: "0 3 * * *"
      GOTOHP_CREDS: "androidId=..."
      GOTOHP_THREADS: "3"          # global default
      SOURCE_PATH_0: /camera
      ALBUM_NAME_0: "Camera Roll"
      GOTOHP_THREADS_0: "8"        # override threads for pair 0 only
      GOTOHP_DELETE_0: "TRUE"      # delete camera files after upload (pair 0)
      SOURCE_PATH_1: /screenshots
      ALBUM_NAME_1: "Screenshots"
      GOTOHP_RECURSIVE_1: "FALSE"  # flat folder — skip sub-directories (pair 1)
      SOURCE_PATH_2: /videos
      # ALBUM_NAME_2 omitted — uploads to library root
    volumes:
      - /mnt/camera:/camera           # read-write — GOTOHP_DELETE_0 is enabled
      - /mnt/screenshots:/screenshots:ro  # read-only is fine; no delete for pair 1
      - /mnt/videos:/videos:ro            # read-only is fine; no delete for pair 2
      - gotohp-config:/config

volumes:
  gotohp-config:
```

### Per-folder albums (AUTO mode)

```yaml
SOURCE_PATH: /organised
ALBUM_NAME: "AUTO"   # creates one album per sub-folder
```

### Per-pair schedules

```yaml
services:
  photos-backup:
    image: ghcr.io/benjithatfoxguy/google-photos-cron-docker:latest
    environment:
      CRON: "0 2 * * *"          # default — pairs 0 and 2 run nightly at 02:00
      CRON_1: "*/30 * * * *"     # pair 1 runs every 30 minutes
      CRON_OVERLAP: "queue"      # queue overlapping runs (default)
      GOTOHP_CREDS: "androidId=..."
      SOURCE_PATH_0: /camera
      ALBUM_NAME_0: "Camera Roll"
      SOURCE_PATH_1: /screenshots
      ALBUM_NAME_1: "Screenshots"
      SOURCE_PATH_2: /videos
      ALBUM_NAME_2: "Videos"
    volumes:
      - /mnt/camera:/camera:ro
      - /mnt/screenshots:/screenshots:ro
      - /mnt/videos:/videos:ro
      - gotohp-config:/config

volumes:
  gotohp-config:
```

### Two Google accounts (per-pair credential overrides)

```yaml
services:
  photos-backup:
    image: ghcr.io/benjithatfoxguy/google-photos-cron-docker:latest
    environment:
      CRON: "0 2 * * *"
      # Alice's credential is the global default
      GOTOHP_CREDS:   "androidId=AAAA..."
      GOTOHP_EMAIL:   "alice@gmail.com"
      # Pair 0 — Alice's photos (uses global credential)
      SOURCE_PATH_0:  /alice-photos
      ALBUM_NAME_0:   "Alice Backup"
      # Pair 1 — Bob's photos (per-pair credential override)
      SOURCE_PATH_1:  /bob-photos
      ALBUM_NAME_1:   "Bob Backup"
      GOTOHP_CREDS_1: "androidId=BBBB..."
      GOTOHP_EMAIL_1: "bob@gmail.com"
    volumes:
      - /mnt/alice:/alice-photos:ro
      - /mnt/bob:/bob-photos:ro
      - gotohp-config:/config

volumes:
  gotohp-config:
```

### Run a one-shot backup immediately

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -e GOTOHP_CREDS="androidId=..." \
  -e SOURCE_PATH=/photos \
  -e ALBUM_NAME="My Backup" \
  -v /mnt/photos:/photos \
  -v gotohp-config:/config \
  ghcr.io/benjithatfoxguy/google-photos-cron-docker:latest backup
```

> **Note:** Pass `-e GOTOHP_DELETE=TRUE` to delete each file after it is
> successfully uploaded.  If you are not using `GOTOHP_DELETE`, you can append
> `:ro` to the source mount for safety.

## Building locally

```bash
docker build -t google-photos-cron-docker .
```

The Dockerfile uses a two-stage build:

1. **Builder** (`golang:1.24-alpine`) — clones the gotohp source at the pinned
   tag, patches `backend/wails_app.go` to exclude the Wails GUI layer when
   compiled with `-tags cli`, and produces a static binary with
   `CGO_ENABLED=0`.
2. **Runtime** (`alpine:3.21`) — copies only the binary and shell scripts;
   no GUI libraries required.
